Hey, This is my first post!

I have been building apps, websites, scripts, and more for companies, brands, e-commerce businesses, and others since 2014. My main technologies are PHP Laravel and JavaScript VueJs, Cloud and E-commerce solutions, So I would like to share everything I know with the community.

At the moment I don't know how it will go, and where my focus will be. But in all cases, it will be the place where I will write about my experiences, thoughts, moments, interests, career, technologies, and more.

I'm just a web developer and not a blogger, and I didn’t have previous experience in blogging. But I will try to commit to posting once every two weeks. I will start posting short articles, then will try to make them better and longer.

Building this website with Jekyll took me about 30 minutes! That was awesome, this is the first time I use it!

In future blog posts, I will tell you more about me, why I’m blogging, and I will also dive into what I will be writing about,  and how you can be in touch with me.  But for now, I’m getting out version one.

That's it, my friends, this is my very first official blog post :D

Thanks for reading
